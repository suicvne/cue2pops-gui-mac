cue2pops Mac is a wrapper around the cue2pops tool adapted to the macOS platform by Erik Andren. This application is written in Swift and was inspired by the cue2pops-gui application on Windows.

## [Downloads](https://github.com/suicvne/cue2pops-gui-mac/releases)
All previous and current versions are offered at the download link above.

## Disclaimers
* This application redistributes a compiled form of cue2pops, specifically the [cue2pops-mac](https://github.com/ErikAndren/cue2pops-mac) project by Erik Andren. In addition, this also redistributes the POPSTARTER.ELF file needed to execute PS1 games through uLaunchELF. Neither of these creations are my own.

# System Requirements

Any Mac running OS X 10.9 Mavericks or higher (OS X 10.10 Yosemite or higher for version 1.1.5), though this app was written and tested in macOS 10.12 Sierra.
